    abstract = {{Topology optimization of fluid dynamic systems is a comparatively young optimal design technique. Its central ingredient is the computation of topological sensitivity maps. Whereas, for finite element solvers, implementations of such sensitivity maps have been accomplished in the past, this study focuses on providing this functionality within a professional finite volume computational fluid dynamics solver. On the basis of a continuous adjoint formulation, we derive the adjoint equations and the boundary conditions for typical cost functions of ducted flows and present first results for two- and three-dimensional geometries. Emphasis is placed on the versatility of our approach with respect to changes in the objective function. We further demonstrate that surface sensitivity maps can also be computed with the implemented functionality and establish their connection with topological sensitivities.

The bend had a curvature radius ratio of 4.0 with long, straight upstream and downstream pipes. The longitudinal, circumferential and radial components of mean and fluctuating velocities, and the Reynolds stresses in the pipe cross section at several longitudinal stations were obtained with the technique of rotating a probe with an inclined hot wire at a Reynolds number of 6×104. The velocity fields of the primary and secondary flows, and the Reynolds stress distributions in the cross section were illustrated. Moreover, other characteristics of the bend flow, such as deviation of the primary flow and intensity of the secondary flow, were presented. Simultaneously, discussions were given on the transition of phenomena in the longitudinal direction and the structures of turbulence in the 90° bend.}},

abstract = "Abstract This article presents the development and application of the continuous adjoint method for designing/optimizing the shape of hydraulic turbomachines. The Reynolds-averaged flow equations are solved in the rotating reference frame and the terms arising from the differentiation of the Coriolis and centripetal forces are taken into account in the formulation of the adjoint equations. The objective functions presented in this article can be used for achieving (a) the optimal collaboration of the runner impeller with the draft tube, by controlling the meridional and circumferential velocity profiles at the exit of the runner, (b) the operation at the desired hydraulic head and/or (c) the cavitation suppression. All of them are used to improve an existing Francis runner. It is important to note that the objective function related to cavitation is, by definition, non-differentiable and a way to effectively handle it, is proposed. The continuous adjoint method is presented in its most general form and could readily be adapted to other objective functions in the field of hydraulic turbomachines. "

In the ALE description, the nodes of the computational domain may be moved with the fluid as in the Lagrangian description, held fixed in space as in the Eulerian description, or moved in some arbitrary way in between. Applying the adjoint method with respect to mesh motion allows the whole sensitivity field for the shape changes to be calculated using only two solver calls, a primal solver call and an adjoint solver call. We show that the sensitivities with respect to the mesh motion can be calculated in a postprocessing step to the primal and adjoint flow simulations. The resulting ALE sensitivities are compared to sensitivities obtained using a finite difference approach. Finally, the sensitivities are coupled to a mesh motion smoothing algorithm, and a duct is optimized with respect to the total pressure drop using the proposed method.},
